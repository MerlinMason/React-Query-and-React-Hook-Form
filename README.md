# NextProject

An mildly opinionated starting point for Next.js projects.

Because setting stuff up is boring and building stuff is fun.

Out of the box support for:

-   Typescript
-   Tailwind (with JIT)
-   Heroicons
-   Eslint (with Airbnb, jsx-a11y etc)
-   Prettier
-   Jest (with Testing Library)
-   Cypress (with Testing Library)

# Development

Install dependencies with `yarn`

Run dev server with `yarn dev`

Create prod build with `yarn build`

Interactively update dependencies with `yarn bump`

Run Jest tests with `yarn test:jest`

Run Cypress tests for dev with `yarn test:cypress:dev`

Run Cypress tests on CLI with `yarn test:cypress`

# Deploy

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
